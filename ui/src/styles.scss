// this is what cui team says you need for typography, and maybe for their components as well
// thing is: this is a lot of code to compile to css and stick in header, when it's already available
// in css form (dist directory), so we'll shove that in assets/cisco-ui for now. This would give us access
// to their cui variables though, say you want a button that matches the header of their card... color is in
// here maybe? Not sure. We'd have to determine if this is their global stylesheet for components, or they
// have something per component. material has a global stylesheet. We also had problems with this cisco-ui
// package getting dropped when you npm install/uninstall stuff. Not sure why, but this will solve that problem
// too.
