### Admin Functionality

We have 2 admin roles: ITAdmin and BizAdmin the former overseeing all modules with the latter associated to a single module. We created another module abbrev: admn (Administration) to accomodate the ITAdmin pages, and decided to use /modules/common/admin directory to house the BizAdmin pages, but so far there are none. MeasureComponent would have been the first, but we opted to put that in with the other common pages for now, along with in with the other menu items as well for now.
