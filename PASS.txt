BUG:
SEE HOW MEAN.IO HANDLES IT, MAYBE THERE'S S TRICK
you're testing out the ui validation, which doesnt' exist, but noted that you weren't getting an api error
even though the validation should have been bad:
1. RuleInput doesn't have required properties, if it did... You'd get an error (verify this)
2. repo.add >> model.save is failing, the mongoose schema validation is failing, BUT...
gq.resolve isn't listening for that for some reason. That doesn't sound right at all. So you decided to throw
an exception, but nobody is listening to that either. Need to next(err), but no middleware in sight in the repo...
also... no middleware cause it's gq. try throwin an error in resolve... nope nothing, even though that's supposed to work. Hmmm. maybe it's the express-graphql middleware?? could be, look at their issues:
https://codeburst.io/custom-errors-and-error-reporting-in-graphql-bbd398272aeb

* you need those promise rejects from mongoose to cause gq errors
* you need to update RuleInput to have required props



pass:
standardized server gq/repo, now need to update ui, for new names and for update/remove updatedDate addition
then back to rule update page.



pass:
have rule list running, now working on create, but decided to refactor for reused for edit.
should be pretty much done iwth the create, to the point of testing. You commented out edit page, once you have create done, then update ruleServie andd rest of code required for edit.

Then.. submeasure list and supposedly done with the database changes so can push.

//////////////////////////// info

me:
* diff between href and href=javascript:void  and href=/pft/rule-management etc

TODO
* need a back link for add/edit pages to get back to list
* need a object dirty check and a warning dialog if they try to cancel or leave and the data has been changed
* concurrency: need a code for this so you can put up the right message when they try to delete something (that still exists) but has been updated. Anytime they delete or update and don't have the latest... they need to get a message: your data needs to be refreshed, not: item not found, as it's there and they're trying to delet it, just that the rule needs to be: if it's changed, then don't update or delete, make them look at the new version as someone else has been messing with it.
* move rule add/update metadata to a modules.json data doc, i.e. in db, and don't add a schema for it, just have it as "string", so module: {id, name, metadata}, then we can update metadata on the fly, but need to wrap well in unit tests so if they change something that will break the ui, we catch it. Say they add one to one array, and it uses that to access another array they didnt' add to and that crashes the code. me's rule add/edit formChange is what needst to be tested well for breakage.
* rule create/edit should be same page
* rule create/update needs to use rule object, not properties on comp
* create graphql classes in ui
* create graphql input classes in qi? Const can enforce required then
* go with ruleAddInput, ruleUpdateInput, or look at their trick with the id on put, then add createdBy/Date to that list
* ruleInput doesnt hahve any required fields
* why is she doing the refetchQueries?? what is that again? graphql thing as it's hitting the server with it
* lazy load modules
* bring in your styles directory if appropriate
* breakcrumb code to: data in routing with store observable and routing done handler that pubs to store with breadcrumb subing to that obs.
* review cui comps to see where they get their css from. Internally (
* mongoose schemas don't recognize dates. Ok or not? Only a problem is you need to mess with a date in repo?
* dump the app comp routing event stuff
* css >> scss
* USE ME'S FIELD NAMES FROM NG CODE FOR DB
* add: allocationInput shouldn't require createdBy/date, updatedby/date, that's the api's job to fill in for add
* update: should have created by/date, but updated isn't required (htough might be there)

database
change csv file headers to what's in the code (camel case) and create a doc that maps between the two:
old line followed by new line with titlte line: allocation_rules, RULE_NAME >> name
