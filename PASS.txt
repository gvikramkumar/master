Looks like you're good for now, get on that file upload/download now


mon:
* file upload/download capbility

project todo
* only latest rule can be updated, but all rules should be visible?

///// framework TODO:
* file upload/download/storage
* need a seqnum in module to line them up for home display, imageName too
* database update strategy: version in db, load all files in sequence and run with mongo using childProcess or so, so a list of directories, then sort by number, then compare db version and run those over that number in sequence

* need a object dirty check and a warning dialog if they try to cancel or leave and the data has been changed
* move rule add/update metadata to a modules.json data doc, i.e. in db, and don't add a schema for it, just have it as "string", so module: {id, name, metadata}, then we can update metadata on the fly, but need to wrap well in unit tests so if they change something that will break the ui, we catch it. Say they add one to one array, and it uses that to access another array they didnt' add to and that crashes the code. me's rule add/edit formChange is what needst to be tested well for breakage.
* lazy load modules
* mongoose schemas don't recognize dates. Ok or not? Only a problem is you need to mess with a date in repo?
