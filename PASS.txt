me:
* diff between href and href=javascript:void  and href=/pft/rule-management etc

TODO
* lazy load modules
* bring in your styles directory if appropriate
* breakcrumb code to: data in routing with store observable and routing done handler that pubs to store with breadcrumb subing to that obs.
* review cui comps to see where they get their css from. Internally (
* mongoose schemas don't recognize dates. Ok or not? Only a problem is you need to mess with a date in repo?
* dump the app comp routing event stuff
* css >> scss
* USE ME'S FIELD NAMES FROM NG CODE FOR DB
* add: allocationInput shouldn't require createdBy/date, updatedby/date, that's the api's job to fill in for add
* update: should have created by/date, but updated isn't required (htough might be there)

database
change csv file headers to what's in the code (camel case) and create a doc that maps between the two:
old line followed by new line with titlte line: allocation_rules, RULE_NAME >> name


pass:
doc: need to bang out that doc and get to ram to get feedback.
fda:
what's been implemented:
rule mgmt: list, create update
submeasure list (but keep the other crud pages)

fixed the page scroll issue, now go through the pages above and make sure they all work, then update db and make all work again with new fields. Then look at your todo list.
