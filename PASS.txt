* make seed take mongouri, then default to local but then arindam can pass in other mongouris
* rul

pass:
db updated FOR RULE ONLY and graphiql updated and tested for rule, NOW DO SUBMEASUERE AND MODULE
then once graphql working for those, come down to UI and fix code



pass:
submeasure graphql done on server
submeasure list running

Now convert db but setup a doc or spreadsheet with the name mapping,
then make the graphql and code work with these new fields. BUT FIRST... check out the code again and see how it maps the camelcase names to the upper snake in db.


pass:
fda:
what's been implemented:
rule mgmt: list, create update
submeasure list (but keep the other crud pages)

fixed the page scroll issue, now go through the pages above and make sure they all work, then update db and make all work again with new fields. Then look at your todo list.


//////////////////////////// info

me:
* diff between href and href=javascript:void  and href=/pft/rule-management etc

TODO
* rule create/edit should be same page
* rule create/update needs to use rule object, not properties on comp
* create graphql classes in ui
* create graphql input classes in qi? Const can enforce required then
* go with ruleAddInput, ruleUpdateInput, or look at their trick with the id on put, then add createdBy/Date to that list
* ruleInput doesnt hahve any required fields
* why is she doing the refetchQueries?? what is that again? graphql thing as it's hitting the server with it
* lazy load modules
* bring in your styles directory if appropriate
* breakcrumb code to: data in routing with store observable and routing done handler that pubs to store with breadcrumb subing to that obs.
* review cui comps to see where they get their css from. Internally (
* mongoose schemas don't recognize dates. Ok or not? Only a problem is you need to mess with a date in repo?
* dump the app comp routing event stuff
* css >> scss
* USE ME'S FIELD NAMES FROM NG CODE FOR DB
* add: allocationInput shouldn't require createdBy/date, updatedby/date, that's the api's job to fill in for add
* update: should have created by/date, but updated isn't required (htough might be there)

database
change csv file headers to what's in the code (camel case) and create a doc that maps between the two:
old line followed by new line with titlte line: allocation_rules, RULE_NAME >> name
